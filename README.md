# Rocky Linux Academy

## Purpose of the project

The Rocky Linux Academy project aims to enrich the methods of using documentation on Rocky Linux by adding the possibility of using presentations for possible courses on the subject.

## Software used

The project uses [Marp](https://marp.app/) (Markdown Presentation Ecosystem), the software is written in Javascript language and released under the MIT license.

The use of this ecosystem makes it possible to create the desired presentations from documents written in Markdown language, the Markdown document through the use of *tags* standardized by **Marp** can be quickly adapted to the specific needs of the presentation (the most common case is the division of a particularly long document into several slides).

### Installation of Marp

NOTE: Installation is not necessary for users of *VS Code* since *Marp* is provided as an extension for this editor.

Installation of the Marp ecosystem provides a set of transformation, document correctness and preview tools that allow full control of presentation creation. All these tools are provided by [Marp CLI](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-cli).
